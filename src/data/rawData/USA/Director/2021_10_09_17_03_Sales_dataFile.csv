Director of Partnerships/Sales,aSweatLife,United States,2 weeks ago,Be among the first 25 applicants,"aSweatLife is seeking a sales professional who is a self-starter, with a passion for people and wellness who is comfortable setting and achieving big goals. The ideal candidate is excited to work in a start-up environment, is happy to work remotely, and they thrive under pressure. They’re also comfortable with a mix of autonomous work and team work.  What’s aSweatLife? Great question. aSweatLife is a media company that creates content and community based on the belief that wellness can be the catalyst to live a better life and achieve your goals.  But, what does aSweatLife stand for? aSweatLife stands for creating a more well-rounded future of wellness for women of all races, shapes and sizes with the power of a community behind them and trusted content to guide them. We are authentic about who we are, intentional about what we create and who we work with.  What is the job, exactly? It’s sales, it’s partnerships, it’s friendship. We look to the Director of Partnerships to carry out and help to plan a strategic vision to bring brands we love to the pages of aSweatLife. Here’s what you can expect on a day-to-day, week-to-week, quarter-to-quarter basis.  Make friends: We’re big believers in the aSweatLife-ism that everything is better with friends. A big part of this role is to identify and research potential clients – you’ll zoom, you’ll chat, you’ll get to know potential partners who could turn out to be paid relationships today or in the future.  Nurture relationships: We’re proud of the relationships we’ve built over our time since launching in 2012. You’ll check in on partners we have long-standing relationships with and build your own rapport with new partners as well. You’ll also be tasked with keeping tabs on brands we love, but who weren’t ready to commit the first time you chatted (we get it – commitment can be scary).   Play on a team: We’re a tight-knit team that communicates openly about what’s going right, what’s going wrong, and when we need space for whatever is unfolding in our personal lives. Because we’re a small team, you may have to put on a different hat to help out a team member. You’ll also have the privilege of working with some of the best people we’ve ever known (we’re biased) – from our full-time team to writers and ambassadors – so it’s pretty easy to chip in when everyone is so wonderful. Set big goals: We plan on an annual basis and we check in on the plan quarterly. You’ll be involved in the planning process that directly impacts the trajectory of the business. You’ll have a say in what you’re working on and the big goals you’re going after.  Keep the team on track: You keep projects moving forward. You’re organized, you create systems and processes – but when you see a way to make things better, you speak up and propose a solution.  Speak aSweatLife: If you’re just meeting us, hi! If you’re familiar with aSweatLife, you already know that our version of wellness is a little bit different. We don’t think it should cost 15% of your salary to be well. We don’t subscribe to or talk about diets. We’re here to create happier, healthier, humans who know what they want and go after it – whether that thing that they want is a book in a bathtub or a promotion. After a ramp-up period, you’ll be fluent in aSweatLife and can independently pitch us and our value to partners and potential partners.  You’re a “Yes, and…” kind of person: We believe in the power of a “yes, and” and if we had to tell you why, it’s because we identify deeply with Tina Fey and Amy Poehler (and their long standing friendship). Because they met doing improv and improv is about listening as much as you talk. You’re here to build up the team – you accept others’ ideas and build on top of them.  Track your progress (and our partners’ progress) to goal: We love a big goal, if you can’t tell by now. We look to our team to track their progress-to-goal and be able to see the success or failure as a constant opportunity to learn and grow.  Sound like something you’d like to do? Here are the skills we’re looking for. Remember, if you have most of these things, but not all of them, we probably still want to meet you.  Experience building a brand within healthy living sphere,  You have contacts that you think would be a great fit for aSweatLife You’re excellent at sales and are excelling at it in your current role You’ve proven yourself in your ability build a business-to-business (B2B) sales pipeline Impeccable verbal and written communication skills You’ve never met a project you can’t manage. You have familiarity with project management methodologies and software  What about compensation? We pay a mix of base and commission for this role. At aSweatLife, we’re transparent about salaries – so we’ll tell you up front that the base salary for this role is $60,000 and you’ll make 10% commission (uncapped) on deals that you close. We also offer equity opportunities.",,Full-time,,

We call our product a ""knowledge engine."" Half of it is a super powerful analytics/data platform (Knoetic). The other half is a social network of C-level executives (CPOHQ).  It seems crazy until you see the product in action. Here's just a small sample of innovative companies that use Knoetic: Amobee, Snyk, Figma, Calm, Curology, Ro, and more.  We're backed by Accel, the founders of public companies, thought leaders like NYT bestselling author Adam Grant, and dozens of leading Chief People Officers.  We're hiring a Head of Sales to build and lead an all-star team. Reporting to our CEO, you will refine and execute our sales strategy, lead a team of Account Executives in acquiring and developing clients, serve as a point of escalation, and help drive deal strategy.  Knoetic's ideal Head of Sales thrives in a start-up environment and has a proven track record of defining a robust sales strategy to scale revenue from $5M-$50M+.

Within your first month, you will: Define a long-term vision and strategy for your team, consulting with existing team members Evaluate existing strategies, processes, and tools, and identify improvement opportunities for immediate focus Implement measurement and reporting processes to manage team performance (Hopefully!) Close your first Knoetic client working alongside our Product, Engineering, and Customer Success.  At three months, you'll be fully ramped! You will: Meet and exceed all quarterly and annual sales quotas, and accurately forecast on a weekly and monthly cadence Demonstrate effective leadership: encourage and develop discipline in process execution, contribute positively to sales interactions including closing your own clients, and foster an environment of collaboration and high-urgency.

You don't want a trophy for effort, you want it for first place. You're high IQ, intellectually curious, and intellectually humble. You're not afraid to say, ""I don't know - but I'll figure it out, fast."" You never say, ""that's not my job"" - you take full ownership and responsibility over outcomes. You're a force of nature that gets the job done no matter what it takes. You make everyone else on the team better. Your presence, positivity, and drive inspires others to step up their game. You put the company above your own wants. You're known for your work ethic. You pride yourself on being one of the hardest-working person most people know. You're constantly improving. You know there's no such thing as perfection, and you're always pushing yourself (and our company) to be better than you were yesterday. You're just good: You're honest, principled, smart, open to giving/receiving feedback, and focused on doing right for the company and doing right for the customer  Why Knoetic? You're incredibly ambitious and want to build the #1 company in this space, without exception. The standard stuff: competitive salary and benefits (including fun perks for lifelong learners, like a $2,500 learning budget!) Knoetic cultural values resonate deeply with you (see below)  Knoetic cultural values  Written by our founder in 2020.  Intellectual curiosity: I want to surround myself with people who are endlessly curious, who are always asking questions, who are fascinated with understanding others and the world around them. We're the kids who grew up always asking ""Why?""  Intellectual humility: I want to work with people who embrace the scientific method, who go into conversations with an open mind and ear, who are looking for ways to sharpen their thinking, who are delighted to find out when they're wrong rather than invested in defending why they're right.  Relentless resourcefulness: Our company should be full of people who will run through walls to get to their goals, who will bring more solutions than problems to others, who will figure out a way to succeed no matter what.  Winning: People who thrive here will only settle for our company being #1. They can only live with themselves if we own the top spot. Second place is last place.  Positive impact on others: There are people, who by the very virtue of their presence, make everyone else around them a better person. It could be because they have unwaveringly high standards. Or are incredible givers that inspire generosity. Or are teachers of their peers. However they do it, they push others upwards. They are culture accretive; their very presence makes everyone else step up their game.  Positivity. You know it when you see it - can-do, optimistic. That doesn't mean everyone doesn't have down moments - it just means on balance, you walk away from your interactions with them energized and charged up to do more with your life.  Continuous improvement: We're always making ourselves better. Stasis is the enemy… if you're not going forwards, you're going backwards. Everything is a work-in-progress in perpetuity - yourself included.",Director,Full-time,Sales and Business Development,Computer Software

You do your best work in highly-structured, steady-paced, and meticulously-planned environments. You like finding and poking holes more than you like filling them.

We know the difference between great customer experience and one that leaves us feeling frustrated and neglected.  A great customer experience is the differentiator when it comes to brand loyalty, repeat purchases and lifetime value.   Thanks to Amazon Prime, our expectations have never been higher when it comes to how quickly we expect brands to respond to us, and we have very little patience when we don’t get what we want.   So why do so many brands still get it wrong?   The problem is the outdated Contact Center Model.   Decades old and never designed for the round the clock world of digital channels like email, chat, text and social media, the traditional model is inflexible and hard to scale.  It’s impossible to stay consistently responsive without ballooning costs, so brands make constant costly trade offs between engaging their customers and deflecting them with bots, forecasting as best they can and hoping to get it right.  They never do!     Simplr set out to solve this problem with a unique Human First, Technology enabled approach.
