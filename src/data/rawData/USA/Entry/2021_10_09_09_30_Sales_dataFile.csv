Outside Sales Representative,Persevus,"New Jersey, United States",,Be among the first 25 applicants,"Outside Sales Representative - New Jersey $60 - $80K First Year (Base plus Commission) Guaranteed $55k Year 1& 2  Good things come to those who wait, like earning over $100,000 a YEAR. And look, you’re in sales, so you understand that patience is a virtue.  The first year will see you lay the foundations. By year two, you’re getting there - with a structure in place for your income to build up on top. But it’s that third year when you’ve established your client base and cemented those key relationships where the rewards will truly flourish. In the case of this Trade Sales Rep role, you can expect to start hitting 6 figures.  Because let’s face it. Making a huge splash right off the bat means you’re either having serious beginner’s luck, or you’re working for Jordan Belfort. And we all know how that ended.  There are no wolves here, so you won’t need to pick up the phone and start dialing. You’re going to be mostly out in the field - meeting with builders, architects, designers, and contractors. In time, you’ll become their go-to contact for high-end building supplies and installations.  To help you succeed, our brand-new showroom and experience center will place your products center stage, allowing your prospects to see them in the best possible light. You’ll get support from management, ownership and autonomy, and the power of an industry-leading brand behind you. Anything is possible here if you’ve got the right skills and attitude.  You will be challenged. But then, you chose sales... Would you have it any other way?  It’s important that you’re energized by the hunt (showing the type of enthusiasm for your work that can’t be faked). You’re from a B2B sales background and you’ll be willing to put in the work and be motivated by the potential returns. Otherwise, what’s the point?  You’ll get a $55k guarantee for 2 years. You’ll likely earn between $60-80k in years 1 & 2, but after that, you’d be expected to earn 6 figures. Ideally, you’ll be based somewhere near Paramus, NJ.  So.

Pre COVID, as with any start-up, we were finding our way, working out the kinks, putting the wheels on the moving bus. 2020 happened and our bus stalled for a few months. We brought it to the shop, swapped some new parts for the old, buffed and waxed it, and came out on the other side stronger, smarter, and yet, still working out the kinks. As the stakes rise, we’re not the puny pre-teen we once were. All that being said, our 90 year old grandpa tells us we never have it all figured out, so we’re not over here trying to. Here we are in the middle of our journey, thankful for the past that built us, and excited for the future that awaits us. Practice makes progress and that’s all we can say about where we are today.

Sales Representative,,United States,1 week ago,Be among the first 25 applicants,"Want to work in the Cannabis Industry FROM HOME? ((Remote)) Compensation: 1099 Commission only $20 - $200+ per sale No license required. Work from home opportunity with no upfront cost.  Free training provided, this is NOT an MLM. If you are interested in making easy calls from home and earning good money, on your own schedule in a relaxed atmosphere with a super cool team, keep reading!  -What is it?  Selling custom stickers, apparel and accessories to businesses over the phone from home.  Check out our website www.redrocksstickers.com or instagram www.instagram.com/redrocksstickers (@redrocksstickers .)  You'll be calling dispensaries (or any other industry) to find ones that are interested in buying custom stickers - not hard-selling stickers to businesses that don't need or want them.  Dispensaries are honestly the easiest industry I have ever put calls into. Generally, everyone you interact with is super nice and the whole industry LOVES stickers.  - How much do I get paid?  $20 to $200+ per sale depending on the order size. It is commission only as a 1099 contractor. Our first contractor got her first sale within her first 3 hours of calling, so it doesn't take long to ramp up. We got to pay a $315 commission on a $4,000 order last month.  About 1 in every 20 calls is a good lead, and about 1 in 3 of those will close. So it takes about 60 calls for a sale. Using a laptop I can make about 50 calls per hour. So pretty quickly you should be making at least $20 / hour. ($20 is the lowest commission for every sale.)  We just had our biggest day yet - I sold over $1,700 worth of stickers yesterday in 7 separate orders. Your commission on that would be at least $20 / sale, you would take home minimum $140 to realistically more like $200 for the day.  -Who are we?  Red Rocks Stickers is a small company owned by myself, Tiffany, and my fiance Brandon. We've been in business for 2.5 years. We run the business from our home in Georgetown, CO.  We are a graphic design, printing and sourcing firm. We work with a crew of over 25 graphic designers and graffiti artists from all over the world to produce some of the hottest merch in the game right now.  We don't have an office yet, we're not some big corporation looking for more bodies to churn through the machine. We have a small network of dedicated people working with us right now and we want to add more people to our team that are just as excited as we are to see where this goes.   -What we're not:  This is not an MLM or Multi-Level Marketing company or Pyramid Scheme. Your compensation is not based on recruiting new employees, only on your personal sales.  -When do I work?  Whenever you want. We have dispensaries to call in all 4 time zones so I make calls anywhere from 8am - 5pm, Mon-Sat. There is no minimum or maximum number of hours and it's on your schedule. The best time to call is Mon - Fri 11am - 4pm.  -What support will I have?  I am available by chat, text and phone most of the day and 24/7 for emergencies.  We will provide you with a call list of dispensaries, usually in your area. Or if you are familiar with a certain industry and know how they can or do use stickers, this is perfect opportunity and I will help you build a call list. All of the one-on-one training you need. Usually it only takes about 2 hours hours to get started.  Weekly phone/web conference with the team to talk about strategies, success and answer questions. We already have and use extensive Google Sheets and HubSpot is our CRM. You can be trained on these as well.  -What do I need?  *Laptop or Desktop computer *Internet Access *Reliable phone service  (You should be able to write off all of those things on your taxes too!)  -What do I do?  Get in touch for a quick phone interview. If this sounds like something you're interested in we'll hook you up with a 1 hour online training course, your own redrocksstickers.com email address, a call script and a list of dispensaries, typically in your area.

And look, you’re in sales, so you understand that patience is a virtue.  The 1st year will see you lay the foundations. In years 2 and 3, you’re getting there - with a structure in place for your income to build up on top. But it’s that 4th year when you’ve established your client base and cemented those key relationships where the rewards will truly flourish. In the case of this Outside Sales Rep role, you can expect to start hitting 6 figures.  Because let’s face it. Making a huge splash right off the bat means you’re either having serious beginner’s luck, or you’re working for Jordan Belfort. And we all know how that ended.  There are no wolves here, so you won’t need to pick up the phone and start dialing. You will be primarily out in the field - meeting with contractors. In time, you’ll become their go-to contact for high-end building materials.   To help you succeed, our showroom and experience center will place your products center stage, allowing your prospects to see them in the best possible light. You’ll get support from management, ownership and autonomy, and the power of an industry-leading brand behind you. Anything is possible here if you’ve got the right skills and attitude.  Saying that, you will be challenged. But then, you chose sales... Would you have it any other way?  It’s important that you’re energized by the hunt (showing the type of enthusiasm for your work that can’t be faked). You’re from a B2B sales background, or maybe even a construction background with an itch for the sales game. Of course, you’ll be willing to put in the work and be motivated by the potential returns. Otherwise, what’s the point?  You’ll get a $50-60k salary, plus commission. You’ll likely earn between $70-95k in years 1-3, but after that, you’d be expected to reach 6 figures. Also, you will need to live somewhere in the Greater Pittsburgh area and drive some sort of SUV or hatchback in order to have samples at the ready. And even if you don’t drive one of these vehicles currently, if you are willing to get one, that works too.   So.
