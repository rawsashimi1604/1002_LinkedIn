Workweeks are Monday-Friday with the occasional weekend when a trade show/conference is scheduled. TSM’s have a complete focus on delivering medical samples, coupons, literature, and other information to ophthalmologists, optometrists, opticians, dermatologists, and Skin Care professionals in their offices. TSM’s also meet with the doctors, staff, and purchaser(s) to directly sell products into the practice. Our business is relationship-driven, so individuals should be comfortable in social interaction within the doctors’ offices. The Company develops and promotes innovative products that require technical presentations, so the preferred candidate will have good communication skills and be conscientious in their study habits to expand their product knowledge. The individual should also be available for overnight travel.  While a degree is appreciated, in recent years, higher education has often failed the best and brightest. Working as a TSM gives both the degreed and non-degreed individual a pathway to the security provided by the health care professions. Historically, OCuSOFT field careers were limited to college-degreed individuals. As a TSM, both groups will have an opportunity to demonstrate their talents and thus move up in the organization. “Come grow with OCuSOFT, the best is yet to be”.  Requirements  The ideal candidate for the Territory Sales Manager is: Friendly Creative Independent A multi-tasker Able to travel overnight - 75% of the time - Road Warrior Organized and possesses good communication skills Able to “think out of the box."" A College degree is appreciated but is not required. Salary commensurate with ability. Benefits  Paid health insurance, paid time off, and eligibility for 401-K savings. This position is one that offers challenges and a growth opportunity tailored to your career plans—now and in the future.  OCuSOFT® is an expanding Eye and Skin Care company marketing a wide range of products. Although OCuSOFT® is principally known as an ophthalmics company, many of its products cross over into Skin Care. This has led to the establishment of a Skin Care Division, OCuSOFT® Aesthetics, operating under the flagship brand, Zoria®. It should be noted that while OCuSOFT® is recognized both domestically and internationally in Eye Care, the Company is less known in the fields of Dermatology, Plastic Surgery, and Medi-Spa outlets which are all markets the Company intends to compete. Accordingly, any potential candidate should possess a strong “first impression” personality and a “breakthrough” competitive spirit in order to offset the market’s lack of familiarity with the Skin Care side of the OCuSOFT® business (OCuSOFT® Aesthetics).  OCuSOFT® Aesthetics offers Zoria® brands of products for eyelids, eyelashes, eyebrows, under eyes, sensitive eyes, and post-procedural products that include, but are not limited to Zoria® Eyelash Intensifying Serum to aid in prolonging the growth cycle of eyelashes creating darker, fuller-looking eyelashes without the side effects of prostaglandin drugs; Zoria® Brow Serum to strengthen and enhance the appearance of fuller eyebrows; Zoria® Under Eye Serum and Cream to reduce puffiness and minimize fine lines and wrinkles around the eyes; Zoria® Recovery, a bruise and scar cream used to minimize bruising from filler injections as well as to reduce the appearance of scars; Zoria® AR Anti-Redness Calming cream for post microdermabrasion, laser procedures, or conditions that cause redness; Zytaze® which is used to heighten the effectiveness of botulinum toxin injections. These products are sold directly to medi-spas, aestheticians/estheticians, or physicians for dispensing as well as online to patients. All of these products have proprietary formulations.  Although OCuSOFT® brands are widely sold in retail outlets such as Walgreen’s; CVS and Wal-Mart, the Zoria® brand is not and there are no plans to do so. This is important so as to avoid direct competition from discount retailers. The purpose is to and educate appropriate call points on these particular products and seek to have Zoria® products purchased to be included in the therapeutic armamentarium.",Mid-Senior level,Full-time,Sales and Business Development,"Medical Devices, Hospital & Health Care, and Pharmaceuticals"

Head Of Sales,,"Omaha, NE",2 weeks ago,Be among the first 25 applicants,"Bulls Eye Recruiting is doing an executive search for a company out of Omaha, NE. Our client is a small company whose work reaches around the globe. The company designs and manufactures air-inflated costumes and inflatable scenic elements. They have a special focus on premiere live entertainment venues, but work with customers in nearly every imaginable industry. Our client is a company built around innovation and creating the best possible version of our clients’ vision.  MISSION:  To create the world’s best inflatable solutions.  PEOPLE:  Our client employees do whatever it takes to deliver successful solutions to our clients. It is not unusual that we find ourselves working on a project brought to us because “everyone else said that it was impossible.” They are creative, versatile, and hard working. When clients visit them from places like Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Hungary – they fly over all of their other options on their way to us. These clients are committed to sourcing the best possible products, and the more committed and informed they are – the more likely they are to end up in Nebraska for their inflatables. Of course our team includes fantastically talented technical artisans - designing and building truly awesome inflatables that consistently impress highly demanding clients (in addition to tens of millions of guests, crowds, live and TV audiences), but all employees share a special attention to detail, and a sense of duty to the successful completion of the project – and this is what makes the company what it is.  CUSTOMERS:  Very few businesses have as diverse of a client base as our client, and fewer still manage this feat with a workforce of less than 25 people. The company has clients in 78 countries around the globe. We have a standout reputation in professional live entertainment – all but two teams in the NBA are clients, we are the go-to inflatable collaborator for the two largest global amusement park groups, we are the only official parade partner of the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, we have partnered on entertainment with the Olympics, the NBA finals, the World Series, and NFL victory parades, we have worked on Broadway, and with leading traveling children’s entertainment shows.  Our client is not limited to professional live entertainment. Our products are used by many consumer brands, all branches of the US Military, hundreds of public safety departments throughout the country, high schools, non-profits, NASA, labor unions, retail stores, software companies, and the USDA (to name just a few). Our customers/partners in these “normal” markets tend to be unique, pioneering leaders within their industries. When the phone rings, we have no idea what line of business or what part of the world the caller might be hailing from – but we generally know that we’re about to engage with a creative and motivated individual, looking for us to create something entirely new, or to use our products in an innovative way. We have worked very closely and well outside of a traditional vendor capacity with clients on projects such as: fire safety educational training with the Phoenix Fire Department, Autism research with the University of Nebraska Medical Center, and the design of integrated national promotions with Frito Lay.  ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITY:  Oversee all aspects of the company’s sales for all industries except professional live entertainment Establish and oversee all sales and marketing efforts, including: Tradeshows and in-person sales Direct contact phone/email/mail campaigns Proposing new business lines with existing clients Online and Social Media efforts Trade groups and other avenues for establishing new business Explore opportunities for expanded product lines Pursue strategic partnerships for referral networks, sponsorships, etc. Engage directly in sales efforts where necessary  While this is an individual contributor role today, the role will move into a leadership role. At that point you will directly manage company’s salespeople, including:  Coordinating and directing salespeople efforts Establishing performance metrics and collaborating to increase targeted performance Hiring of additional staff  Partner with company owner on live entertainment sales: -Discuss and coordinate marketing/sales efforts  EXPECTED OUTCOME:  We expect a substantial re-focusing of the company’s sales efforts in the first 6 months. We would like to see these changes yield a 50% increase in non-live entertainment revenue for this hire’s 2nd year on board. We fully expect that these efforts will be disruptive; however they must respect the company’s mission and ethics.

Proactivity - We should be focused on identifying + solving problems before they happen, not reacting to problems once they happen. To do this, we need to be intimately acquainted with the accounts we are managing and closely monitoring performance to identify anything that is amiss. This means uctuations in spend or key performance indicators (such as CPA or return on ad spend) whether at the holistic account level or on individual campaigns. We also need to have responsibility for driving accounts or projects forward. If you don’t know what to do or don't have anything to do, then you should identify what you can do that will help move the needle, whether for a partner or for our company as a whole. You can certainly ask a manager for guidance as needed too but the responsibility for aging that you don't know what to do next is on you.   Ownership - We need to treat our clients' money like our own and take full responsibility and accountability for outcomes. Individual account managers must take responsibility for the performance of their account. If something is needed from a manager or the partner in order to be successful, we need to give that to the relevant party and make sure they are aware versus wait for them to act on it. If we sense there is something missing in order to be successful, we need to identify what that is and gure out the best way to address it.   Radical Transparency - Everyone should feel free to offer their opinions or criticism to anyone else. Anything that seems amiss or that could be done better needs to be tagged and a conversation needs to be had. Everyone should feel comfortable accepting and receiving critical feedback to or from anyone else.   Believability Weighted Decisions - Confirm that you are right in any decision by checking with trusted sources, whether from internal stakeholders, resources available online, general best practices. Consider all inputs and decide which source is the most believable, dont blindly trust something that has been done this way in the past or what any one person or source says is right. However, do account for the believability of that source. If someone has 10 years of experience in Google Ads (and you have less) but you disagree with their conclusion, then you need to have a good reason and feel confident in why.  Radical Truth - We want to embrace radical truth. This sets us apart from other agencies that may want to skew the truth in order to impress clients and amplify their perceived performance. We want to go beyond the performance of just our campaigns and understand how it is impacting the clients bottom line. We also need to be able to assess our true value and make sure that it outweighs the cost of having us work on the project. We should emphasize this in communication with our clients.   React on negative outcomes to drive learning + improvement - If an outcome is negative (ie. if a relationship with a partner fails or a specific campaign or project is not a success), we need to take the time to detect and diagnose the reasons why and use that to inform the next project and learn from our mistakes.   Consider second and third order consequences - There are immediate implications to decisions, for instance, if I increase the CPC bid on a branded campaign then my CPCs will go up but hopefully also will the impressions, clicks, and sales from that campaign. However, there are also additional consequences. For instance, a competitor might raise their bids and then costs will go up without much or any impact on volume. We might cannibalize organic search and thus the net impact to the client is neutral or negative. We may be okay with those consequences but we need to consider them and use our north star and the structure of our deal with the partner as our guide.  Continual Learning & Improvement - Each person should take on the responsibility for becoming experts in their field and for enhancing the knowledge of other people at the company. We should stay abreast of the latest developments in the eld and be subject matter experts.",Mid-Senior level,Full-time,Sales and Business Development,Marketing and Advertising
