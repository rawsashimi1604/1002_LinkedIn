(“FLEETCOR”) is a leading global provider of business payment solutions. We help companies of all sizes control, simplify and secure payment of various domestic and cross-border payables using specialized payment products. We serve businesses, partners, merchants, consumers and payment networks in North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. $2.4B Annual Revenue 600,000 Directly Served Business Clients 2.6B+ Transactions per Year 8,400+ Employees (as of December 31, 2020)  Our payment solutions provide our customers with a payment method designed to be superior to and more robust and effective than what they use currently, whether they use a competitor’s product or another alternative method such as cash or check. We group our payment solutions into five primary categories: Fuel, Lodging, Tolls, Corporate Payments and Gift. Each category is unique in its focus, customer base and target markets, but they also share a number of characteristics: customers are primarily businesses, have recurring revenue models, have specialized networks which create barriers to entry, have high margins, and have similar selling systems.  FLEETCOR Enjoys Global Recognition Including Forbes Global Growth Champion – FLEETCOR is one of the 250 fastest growing companies in the world as determined by Forbes and Statista Forbes World’s Most Innovative Companies – FLEETCOR has made this prestigious list of leading innovative companies 4 years in a row! Fortune 1000 Company – FLEETCOR was one of the largest movers in the new rankings of the largest companies in America, ranking#872 S&P 500 – In 2018, FLEETCOR joined the S&P stock index comprised of the 500 leading US stocks based on market cap (company value) Our Vision  Despite many advances in our industry, the majority of business payments are still made with outdated and inferior payment methods, such as checks and cash. We envision a business world where every purchase is controlled, every payment is digital, and every payment-related decision is well-informed. In this future paperless state, payments will require little to no time to manage, leaving companies with more time for what matters most: activities that grow their businesses.  Our Mission  FLEETCOR’s mission is to provide businesses with a better way to pay, by replacing outdated payment methods such as checks and cash, and displacing the incumbent providers of those methods. Through the digitalization of payments, we create and support robust ecosystems which benefit all participating constituents: payment-making customers, payment-accepting merchants, tax-collecting governments, and FLEETCOR.  Our Strategy  FLEETCOR is a growth company, and we employ a simple three-prong strategy for growing our business: More Customers. We invest more than $200 million per year in sales and marketing, predominately focused on new customer acquisition. We continue to scale existing sales channels and headcount, enable our sales people with demand generation and other tools, and launch new distribution channels both internally and through partners such as ERP software providers, telematics companies, and banks. We will also grow our customer base inorganically through acquisitions. More Spend. We seek to leverage our existing customer relationships and capture greater share of their business payment expenditures. As such, we have developed various “beyond” initiatives, where we extend the utility of an existing payment product without degrading the core value proposition of the original product. As such, a customer can “buy more stuff” without sacrificing the controls and reporting which attracted the customer to our product to begin with. For example: Our Fuel card customers can enable their cards to allow non-fuel purchases relevant to their business, like allowing a painting crew to buy supplies at a home improvement store, so they can finish the paint job. Our Toll tag customers can use their in-vehicle RFID tags to make other “on the go” purchases like parking, fuel and fast-food. For our customers, these product extensions reduce payment friction, saving them time and operational headaches. For FLEETCOR, these product extensions can increase our share of wallet with existing customers and can increase our products’ appeal and applicability to previously-unserved customer segments (e.g., non-toll urban dwellers). We also create new product offerings, developed internally or in conjunction with partners, to cross-sell to our existing customer base. More Geographies. We continue to seek attractive entry opportunities in major international markets, which we intend to pursue through acquisitions and partnerships. Our Commitment to Diversity, Equality, Inclusion, Belonging  We Are Therefore Committed To Building And Nurturing a Culture Of Diversity, Inclusion, And Belonging By  Together we can foster true belonging.We know different ideas, perspectives and backgrounds lead to better innovation and results. Welcoming people of different backgrounds, cultures, ethnicities, genders, and sexual orientations; Empowering our people to share their experiences and ideas through open forums and individual conversations; and Valuing each person’s unique perspectives and individual contributions. Embracing diversity enables our people to “make the difference” at FLEETCOR.  Our Values  Our Entrepreneurial Spirit Remains Strong Across Our Global Workforce, And We Reinforce These Principles In Our Five Core Values  FLEETCOR’s culture reflects our history of fast growth and our continued drive for results. Innovation: Figure out a better way Execution: Get it done quickly Integrity: Do the right thing People: We make the difference Collaboration: Accomplish more together These values guide all of our employees and are infused in all aspects of our Company. We are, as a team, united through these shared values and our mission to provide “a better way to pay.”  Our values foster an inclusive culture through the expectation that all employees will treat each other with respect and appreciate the diversity of identities, thoughts, backgrounds and styles. Our commitment to fostering an inclusive culture has never been more essential than in this moment of national reflection.We must always celebrate the diversity of our company and our communities.

We know it, too. It's the way we're stacking our talent pack -- with people who will join us to achieve nothing short of our Core Purpose: We crash the ceilings that limit clients' growth potential. It's a charge none of us takes lightly. As one pack member said: ""Every day I leave with a feeling that I have actually accomplished something."" That's, no doubt, why Zippia named RedRover one of the top 5 Best Places to Work in Memphis, Tennessee.  Our Core Values also are also a big part of what makes RedRover special:  Courageous.  Agents of change.  Incurable need for results.  Win -- with the team win before the self win.  Self-disciplined and accountable.  Located in the heart of downtown Memphis, RedRover is a team of change agents eager to measurably move the needle for clients. We are courageous, laser-focused and have a downright incurable need to deliver results. Sure, we're definitely competitive by nature and incredibly hard-working, but it’s not all about work.  Walk through our front doors and you’ll be greeted by our infamous mascot, Rover -- a giant mosaic statue built by a local artist.  Stop by on a Friday, and you’ll get to meet some of our own Rovers, as this is a dog-friendly workplace where creative breaks with our canine visitors are encouraged.  RedRover actively encourages team members to recharge their minds and bodies. Employees can relax in the Bark Bistro or get away from it all in the Rover Retreat.  At the end of a week, you might find us gathered for some team building, an occasional highly competitive game of Jenga, and celebration of that week’s victories.  There's perhaps no better way to learn what RedRover is all about than from our pack members. Here's what they have to say about the RedRover experience.  ""Very progressive work environment. Talented coworkers. They are currently experiencing rapid growth so there are plenty of opportunities to move up the ladder.""  ""I’ve been at RedRover for three years now. It is a super fast-paced environment that delivers top-notch work. The team is very creative and results-driven and I continue to be blown away by my colleagues.""  ""I've never worked with so many smart, funny, and talented people! It's a pleasure to come to work here every day. It's an inclusive environment and a perfect place to grow in your career or your skillset. I've worked here for almost three years-that's 21 in dog years-and I love what I do. Very positive environment. Commitment matters here. Ethics matter here. Relationships matter here. Trust matters here. Best of all, creativity abounds here! We work hard, make no mistake about it, but we have a lot of fun while we work.""  ""Great teamwork, smart management, transparency throughout, and the ability to grow within your role.""  ""Management places a high amount of trust and empowerment to employees who show initiative and who prove they can be trusted. I've had more variety in my work and more opportunities to stretch myself into new areas and skill sets than in any organization I've ever worked with. I've truly had an opportunity to make my own way here. When you work here, you're never ""locked"" into a position or job description. If you discover a way to add value, I've found you are empowered to go ahead and tackle that new task or project or solve that problem you see. The team I get to work with is brilliant and talented. Here, you'll be empowered to make decisions, and you'll be supported when you make mistakes (and given the opportunity to learn from them and move on). Bottom line - I've grown A LOT in my relatively short amount of time here.""

The Apprentice Manage Lead will 1) ensure that apprentice managers are inspired by the potential of our programs, 2) equip managers to proactively support apprentices to make rapid progress and to complete their competencies, and 3) support managers to effectively guide, coach and mentor their apprentices as new challenges arise.
