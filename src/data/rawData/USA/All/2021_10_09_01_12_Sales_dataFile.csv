Sales - US Commercial,Palantir Technologies,"New York, NY",,Be among the first 25 applicants,"A World-Changing Company  At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves real problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.  The Role  Around the world, data is being generated at an exponential rate, and many government agencies and commercial institutions worldwide are ill-equipped to handle data at scale. Palantir’s software helps these organizations build data assets that enables efficient analysis and more effective management of their data, empowering them to solve their most critical problems.  The Sales Team is responsible for getting Palantir’s software to these organizations. Sales Reps find, evaluate, and pursue new business opportunities for a targeted institution or geography, seeking partners whose missions, objectives, and values align with our own. Each institution is different and each country has its own way of procuring software, and Sales Reps see these distinctions as opportunities — for creative thinking, diligent research, and value creation. Successful Sales Reps tailor their approach to Palantir and to each unique opportunity, rather than relying on past strategies for selling other enterprise software.  Armed with a deep knowledge of the product and its real-world applicability, Sales Reps cultivate existing relationships and work diligently to build new ones. Motivated by the knowledge that the software they sell is directly responsible for uncovering fraud, stopping wrongdoing, and saving lives, Sales Reps exceed ambitious sales quotas and come up with new targets.  Core Responsibilities In coordination with Palantir leadership, develop and execute a comprehensive strategy for growing the company's presence in a defined government or commercial institution and/or geography, typically focused on a single or limited number of customers. Generate new leads and business opportunities, working closely with Palantir counterparts to determine goals and targets. Serve as the key point of contact between Palantir and given institution(s), and represent Palantir's Sales Team at industry events and conferences. Develop deep familiarity with Palantir's software platforms and how they can be used to solve a wide range of real-world problems. Exceed stated sales quota by winning enterprise contracts. Work with the other Sales team members to improve and streamline internal processes. What We Value Proven track record of large-scale enterprise sales to government or commercial institutions. Intricate familiarity with procurement processes. Excellent communication skills. Ability to compellingly articulate Palantir's product offering to audiences with varying levels of technical skill and seniority. Ability to understand potential customers' requirements and how Palantir's software can address them. Demonstrated project management skills and a love of getting things done, no matter the circumstances. Experience building and managing relationships, and collaborating with internal partners and external counterparts. Ability to travel (50%+) per business needs. To Apply Please submit a cover letter and resume along with a record of your sales experience, including the size of the deals you have closed (feel free to use X for the values you are not able to disclose; for instance, $XX million). Please upload them as a single PDF file using the “Attach Resume/CV"" tool on the applicant page.

Head Of Sales,,"Omaha, NE",2 weeks ago,Be among the first 25 applicants,"Bulls Eye Recruiting is doing an executive search for a company out of Omaha, NE. Our client is a small company whose work reaches around the globe. The company designs and manufactures air-inflated costumes and inflatable scenic elements. They have a special focus on premiere live entertainment venues, but work with customers in nearly every imaginable industry. Our client is a company built around innovation and creating the best possible version of our clients’ vision.  MISSION:  To create the world’s best inflatable solutions.  PEOPLE:  Our client employees do whatever it takes to deliver successful solutions to our clients. It is not unusual that we find ourselves working on a project brought to us because “everyone else said that it was impossible.” They are creative, versatile, and hard working. When clients visit them from places like Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Hungary – they fly over all of their other options on their way to us. These clients are committed to sourcing the best possible products, and the more committed and informed they are – the more likely they are to end up in Nebraska for their inflatables. Of course our team includes fantastically talented technical artisans - designing and building truly awesome inflatables that consistently impress highly demanding clients (in addition to tens of millions of guests, crowds, live and TV audiences), but all employees share a special attention to detail, and a sense of duty to the successful completion of the project – and this is what makes the company what it is.  CUSTOMERS:  Very few businesses have as diverse of a client base as our client, and fewer still manage this feat with a workforce of less than 25 people. The company has clients in 78 countries around the globe. We have a standout reputation in professional live entertainment – all but two teams in the NBA are clients, we are the go-to inflatable collaborator for the two largest global amusement park groups, we are the only official parade partner of the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, we have partnered on entertainment with the Olympics, the NBA finals, the World Series, and NFL victory parades, we have worked on Broadway, and with leading traveling children’s entertainment shows.  Our client is not limited to professional live entertainment. Our products are used by many consumer brands, all branches of the US Military, hundreds of public safety departments throughout the country, high schools, non-profits, NASA, labor unions, retail stores, software companies, and the USDA (to name just a few). Our customers/partners in these “normal” markets tend to be unique, pioneering leaders within their industries. When the phone rings, we have no idea what line of business or what part of the world the caller might be hailing from – but we generally know that we’re about to engage with a creative and motivated individual, looking for us to create something entirely new, or to use our products in an innovative way. We have worked very closely and well outside of a traditional vendor capacity with clients on projects such as: fire safety educational training with the Phoenix Fire Department, Autism research with the University of Nebraska Medical Center, and the design of integrated national promotions with Frito Lay.  ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITY:  Oversee all aspects of the company’s sales for all industries except professional live entertainment Establish and oversee all sales and marketing efforts, including: Tradeshows and in-person sales Direct contact phone/email/mail campaigns Proposing new business lines with existing clients Online and Social Media efforts Trade groups and other avenues for establishing new business Explore opportunities for expanded product lines Pursue strategic partnerships for referral networks, sponsorships, etc. Engage directly in sales efforts where necessary  While this is an individual contributor role today, the role will move into a leadership role. At that point you will directly manage company’s salespeople, including:  Coordinating and directing salespeople efforts Establishing performance metrics and collaborating to increase targeted performance Hiring of additional staff  Partner with company owner on live entertainment sales: -Discuss and coordinate marketing/sales efforts  EXPECTED OUTCOME:  We expect a substantial re-focusing of the company’s sales efforts in the first 6 months. We would like to see these changes yield a 50% increase in non-live entertainment revenue for this hire’s 2nd year on board. We fully expect that these efforts will be disruptive; however they must respect the company’s mission and ethics.  OPPORTUNITY:   This position is significant leadership at a globally-leading niche firm which is nimble enough to adapt and pursue a wide range of opportunities in a wider range of markets – at a company with a strong foundation to support transformative growth.",Mid-Senior level,Full-time,Sales and Business Development,Consumer Services and Marketing and Advertising
