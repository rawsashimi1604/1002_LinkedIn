We like to work with “big thinkers yet hands-on in execution”.  As a team, we’re collaborative and come from diverse backgrounds. We value creativity in research, and an outside-in perspective when it comes to inspiration, strategic frameworks and problem-solving.

We like to work with “big thinkers yet hands-on in execution”.  As a team, we’re collaborative and come from diverse backgrounds. We value creativity in research, and an outside-in perspective when it comes to inspiration, strategic frameworks and problem-solving.

Lastly, a genuine belief in bringing your full self to what you do everyday, see “work” as a calling and a passion. What You Should Know About VaynerMedia  Think “lab” and not “agency”. We get excited about solving business problems, not creating advertising for the sake of making advertising. Our entrepreneurship DNA runs deep. We’re willing to break rules, try new things, and test hypotheses if it means better understanding our craft. It’s fun!  Our environment (and pace) feels much more like a start-up than most agencies you might be used to.

As the travel industry continues to rebound, Hopper has seen its valuation more than double since early 2020, reflecting the strength of our mobile-only marketplace and the value customers are deriving from our proprietary suite of fintech offerings.  Here are just a few stats that demonstrate our recent growth: Hopper’s valuation is now over $3.5B, reflecting the strength of its mobile-only marketplace and value customers are deriving from the company’s proprietary suite of fintech offerings. Based on its current run rate, Hopper is pacing towards 330% revenue growth compared to last year, and it has already surpassed its pre-pandemic revenue peak from Q1 2020 by over 100%. Hopper has over 60 million downloads, consistently ranks as one of the most downloaded travel apps, and now has a larger air travel market share in North America than it did before the pandemic (source: MIDT). The company is on track to surpass $1.5 billion in travel sales this year, with 40% coming from the hotel and car rental categories. Hopper’s fintech offerings, such as Price Freeze and Rebooking Guarantee, now represent 50% of its revenue. Given the success of its travel fintech, Hopper recently launched a B2B initiative called Hopper Cloud , where any travel provider can unlock a totally unique revenue stream by seamlessly integrating and offering Hopper’s travel fintech. The industry opportunity for Hopper Cloud is enormous as projections estimate that if all travel distribution channels offered travel fintech, it could increase the total consumer spend for the sector by $200 billion annually.  All this recent growth is just the beginning. There are still so many new opportunities we’re excited to tackle in the next year!",Director,Full-time,Engineering and Information Technology,"Information Technology and Services, Computer Software, and Internet"
