The company's website can be viewed here: http://fredrikmarine.com  The firm is headed by Nicholas Chan, a Singapore serial entrepreneur, business mentor and former early stage venture capitalist. His profile can be viewed here: http://linkd.in/nicholaschancj  What is the Entrepreneurial Internship  The Entrepreneurial Internship is currently into its 13th year, having first started with Azione Capital taking in its first apprentice in 2006.  Alumni of the Entrepreneurial Internship has went on to start (and sell) their own companies, others worked their way rapidly into leadership positions within other organisations and some stayed on to head up companies with Nicholas and his team.  Structured in the form of a classic 3 year apprenticeship with the focus on the transference of skills by the principal of ""do as I say, learn from how I do"", everything is practically taught by highly experienced businessmen and not by theoretical academics, corporate staff or government officials.  The Entrepreneurial Internship has a typical annual intake of 1 - 2 individuals. All shortlisted applicants will be put into a 3-phase interview spanning an average of 1 1/2 months. At the last phase of the interview, the individual will be asked on which track will he/she want to be primarily trained in, the duration of the training they are committing to (6 months, 1 year, 2 years) and the milestones they will be committing to achieve during the training period.  Since 2016, the Entrepreneurial Internship has opened up its multi-disciplinary training to allow outstanding long term 2-year apprentices to work across multiple companies that Nicholas and his business associates are involved in (business consulting, early stage investments, fashion apparel group, software development house, agriculture technology and supplies), spanning various SouthEast Asian countries (Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam).  Why would you want to work in Fredrik Marine You want to get your hands dirty and learn first-hand on the ground just how a small technology company really runs, and to be deeply involved in this process. You are the type of person whereby when you see a problem, you fix it immediately; you do not assemble a committee to discuss the problem for the next 2 years. You want to be recognised and measured by the results of your own two hands, and not be the paper qualifications you possess/not possess, and definitely NOT by the perfect 4.0 GPA you may/ may not have. In return, you will learn to measure a company not by how much money it raised, nor by the sheer amount of press coverage it gets, not by the ""cool hip"" factor of being associated with it, but by how much revenue it is making and will be making in the future, by the impact of how much value it creates for itself, its stakeholders and its clients. You have the insatiable need to get meaningful and productive things done rather than wasting your time on Facebook/Twitter/Instagram; you don't fancy being stuck behind a desk and abhor going for meaningless time-wasting mind-and-ego-inflating shallow events. You actively seize problems and seek problems to fix, and ""getting things done"" is as natural as breathing to you. To you, anywhere is an office as long as you can get your tasks done, and anytime is the measure of your capabilities and abilities to perform. You believe in results, focusing on ""the mission first"" as opposed to imagined outrage. Whatever your life situation and circumstances, you are constantly driven with the burning desire for success, pushing over and beyond your boundaries and limitations to achieve your mission objectives. Learning as you go is an ability that is second nature to you. Responsibilities and Duties  As an entrepreneurial intern at Fredrik Marine, you will be given multiple challenges to meet, genuine opportunities to learn and the ability to decide what you want to earn. As at August 2019, there are numerous ongoing product representation negotiations and contract signings, ongoing sector-segmented marketing campaigns, active expansion activities into 2 Asian countries and the USA, a massive overhaul operation on all corporate materials, a broader engagement strategy on maritime community engagement; there is never a dull moment.  Who will you work with and learn from  You Will Be Working Alongside The Managing Director, Operations Manager And R&D Engineer For a Minimum Of 6 Months Up To a Maximum Of 2 Years (we Are Fine With You Doing This Internship During Your School Term) On Any Combination Of The Belowmentioned Areas; Do Note That This List Is NOT Exhaustive  Business Development Structure existing and new products/services into sector-based solutions Create/rewrite/refactor product/services corporate collateral Work together with the direct mail staff on monthly campaigns Streamline and clean up the direct mail campaign regional databases Establish and nurture new channels in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Philippines for certain key product lines Work with existing clients to better understanding their needs (current and future), and structuring engagement plans for next 12 months for each individual client Re-work existing sales deck, re-factor into segment-based decks Meet with new clients and present together with either Managing Director or business development staff Design, deploy and maintain business development campaigns, including lead generation and relationship building Project Management Design, development and beta deployment of a cloud-based maritime services Launch of various brand distribution/technical representation into SouthEast Asia Expansion of yachting sector business scope and coverage Requirements  Having the Right Mindset  Ask not what your internship can do for you, but what you can do for yourself, your mentor and your own future. You are a person that measure your internship not by the hours you clock-in but by the number of opportunities you can seize and act upon. In your work, you ensure that your yes is yes, and your no is no. Your focus is on the needs of the customer, not on yourself or your personal comfort. You believe that if anything is to be done, it must be done to the very best of your abilities; you do not give excuses and find someone/something else to blame. You expect, and even demand that your internship to be one where you will stretch your limits and discover your potential to the fullest, outside your years spent in theory-based educational environments. You always seek to do what is meaningfully hard, not what is convenient and a easy addition to your ""feather in your cap"" collection. No Age and Gender Discrimination  Whether you are a fresh GCE O level graduate (Nicholas started his first company right after his GCE O levels when he was 16) or a corporate person looking into an entrepreneurial career and wanting to get your feet wet in a rapidly changing entrepreneurial environment, feel free to apply!  Less Emphasis On Educational Qualifications  We DO NOT scrutinize your educational qualifications. While we recognise that being able to communicate and write in basic English is important, these are the X-factors that we will really look out for: Ability to get things done, and done with excellence Self driven and work autonomously; this is an Entrepreneurial internship after all, not a job Have a great attitude; knowing how and when to say Please, Thank You and I am sorry is critical Always going the extra mile; we aim to please Continuous learning; we recognize that we learn by doing, and that making mistakes are fine as long as we correct ourselves. Listen actively and pro-active in finding solutions to problems rather than always waiting for instructions Have a good moral compass; we do business right. So GCE 'O' level, GCE 'A' level students, ITE graduates, Polytechnic and University graduates, are all welcome!  How to Apply for the Entrepreneurial Internship  If You Like What You Are Reading So Far, Send In Your Application And Tell Us The Following (a Paragraph For Each Question Is Good Enough, We Just Want To Know What Makes You Tick) Why you are the person we must have on our team, and what you bring to the table. Tell us about what you want to achieve in your life and how this internship would play a critical role in your life journey.
