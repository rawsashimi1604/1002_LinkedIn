Sales Manager,Maine Streets Securities,"Singapore, Singapore",2 months ago,Be among the first 25 applicants,"Who is Maine Streets Securities?  Maine Streets Securities collateralized stock loans give investors another mechanism to realize near-immediate liquidity from the unrestricted, publicly-traded stocks that are in their portfolios. In a typical stock loan, the investor will borrow a sum of cash that is a percentage of the value of the collateral stock that the investor will pledge to secure the loan. Most stock lenders will lend from 20% to 70% of the value of the stock. The final loan-to-value that a lender will offer will be a function of the fundamental financial strength of the issuer of the stock and the average daily trading volume of that particular stock.  Most collateralized stock loans are for terms of between one and five years. The borrower pays simple interest during the loan term and repays the loan principal balance on the loan maturity date. Alternatively, the borrower can elect to retain the full principal balance, in which event the lender assumes full possession and ownership of the collateral stock and the transaction terminates with no further liability on the part of either party.  As with all transactions involving publicly-traded stock, a borrower should always consult his or her financial, legal, tax, and accounting advisors to understand the full implications of a stock loan and a potential default before engaging in a collateralized stock loan transaction. A stock loan lender will facilitate a transaction but will not make or provide any warranties or representations on how the transaction will affect the borrower’s financial profile.  The Role  You Will Be Responsible For Acting as the primary point of contact and delivering excellent service standards and advice to clients for their enquiries, complaints, and other service-related issues.

In this fast-paced role, an Associate can expect to interact with up to 20 projects on any given day.  You will begin your tenure as a member of the trading desk. In that capacity, you are focused on project management and primarily communicate with language professionals. Day-to-day responsibilities will include:  Project management of large-scale translation/interpretation requests; Using Salesforce to review a pipeline of projects and determine task prioritization; Matchmaking client requests according to translator/interpreter/transcriber availability; Phone or in-person briefings with account managers for project management updates; Recruiting new translators/interpreters/transcribers as needed using LinkedIn and other communities; Chronicling your interactions in Salesforce.

Working Hours  The Associate role is demanding. It requires long hours, as well as an ""always-on"" mentality. Successful Associates will demonstrate resilience in the face of these demands.  We have structured working hours to balance our clients' needs with the goals for predictable work by our Associates.  Monday through Friday, you will have dedicated ""desk time"", where you are expected to be present and support the goals of your desk; One or two days a week, you will have three hours of protected ""off-desk time"", where colleagues cannot schedule meetings and you can ensure free time on your calendar for personal errands or side projects.

In Singapore, ""desk time"" is either 10am-7pm or 1pm-10pm (subject to change). Outside of these hours, Associates in other offices are working to delight clients. Therefore, successful Associates will demonstrate the ""always on"" mentality and recognize that they should be responsive to changes in business conditions. Sometimes this can merely mean checking Slack messages before and after your desk time. Other times it can be starting your day early or staying late to help colleagues.
