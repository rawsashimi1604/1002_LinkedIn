Here are just a few stats that demonstrate our recent growth: Hopper’s valuation is now over $3.5B, reflecting the strength of its mobile-only marketplace and value customers are deriving from the company’s proprietary suite of fintech offerings. Based on its current run rate, Hopper is pacing towards 330% revenue growth compared to last year, and it has already surpassed its pre-pandemic revenue peak from Q1 2020 by over 100%. Hopper has over 60 million downloads, consistently ranks as one of the most downloaded travel apps, and now has a larger air travel market share in North America than it did before the pandemic (source: MIDT). The company is on track to surpass $1.5 billion in travel sales this year, with 40% coming from the hotel and car rental categories. Hopper’s fintech offerings, such as Price Freeze and Rebooking Guarantee, now represent 50% of its revenue. Given the success of its travel fintech, Hopper recently launched a B2B initiative called Hopper Cloud , where any travel provider can unlock a totally unique revenue stream by seamlessly integrating and offering Hopper’s travel fintech. The industry opportunity for Hopper Cloud is enormous as projections estimate that if all travel distribution channels offered travel fintech, it could increase the total consumer spend for the sector by $200 billion annually.
