We’re also an organization of industry experts and engineers focused on solving problems and building solutions. We’re a concierge customer success team and a 24/7 support team. We’re a communications partner, focused on agile and endless innovation, not a telecom slogged in antiquated processes and anti-competitive regulation. We keep the conversation going: the always-on, omnichannel, enriched conversation that the modern world demands.  Communications are coming untethered from devices, and more and more, they’re migrating into our everyday platforms: our social media, our work applications, and our collaboration tools. But, that move started before there was infrastructure to support it—the modern internet will never offer the speed and consistency that real-time communications require. So, we built a network that does and a cloud platform tuned for real-time communications at every layer.  Telnyx is the connective matrix, a worldwide nervous system, a high-speed rail tunneling through the information superhighway. We’re the foundation for calls, texts and messaging today, for the internet of things, augmented reality and “communitainment” tomorrow, and for whatever enterprising imaginations can dream up after that. We’re Telnyx. We’re the future of communications.  At Telnyx, we're looking for people with passion, grit, and integrity. You're encouraged to apply even if your experience doesn't precisely match the job description. Your skills and passion will stand out—and set you apart—especially if your career has taken some extraordinary twists and turns. At Telnyx, we welcome diverse perspectives and people who think rigorously and aren't afraid to challenge assumptions. Join us.",Associate,Full-time,Sales and Business Development,Telecommunications

"Senior Software Engineer in Test, Client Retention team",Toptal,"Nizhniy Novgorod, Nizhniy Novgorod, Russia",2 weeks ago,Be among the first 25 applicants,"About Toptal  Toptal is a global network of top freelance talent in business, design, and technology that enables companies to scale their teams, on-demand. With $200+ million in annual revenue and over 40% year-over-year growth, Toptal is the world’s largest fully remote company.  We take the best elements of virtual teams and combine them with a support structure that encourages innovation, social interaction, and fun. We see no borders, move at a fast pace, and are never afraid to break the mold.  Position Description  Toptal is a quality-first company. While quality is the responsibility of the whole team, our Software Engineers in Test lead this effort. We believe that top quality can only be reached by ensuring this on the product, engineering, and team level.  As a member of the Client Retention team, you’ll have the opportunity to bring value to our amazing Sales teams, by ensuring our new and shiny tools are free from defects. Being a product team, you will work closely with our product manager on exciting product - as well as technical - challenges.  Our team’s domain includes the ownership of client data, and tools which help make our sales teams smile. One of these tools is a homegrown system that allows two-way data synchronization between Platform and Salesforce. We mostly work with Ruby on the backend, and Typescript on the frontend, but we also dabble in APEX.  When we’re not working on data synchronization, we are working with an established modern (React, TypeScript, Webpack, Babel, Jest, RTL, to name a few) front-end architecture, backed up with a robust backend tech stack of Ruby on Rails and GraphQL. This is used by many other teams in Toptal too. We are also building our UI using our in-house built components library, Picasso. For end-to-end tests, we are more and more extensively using Cypress as our primary testing framework.  This is a remote position that can be done from anywhere. Due to the remote nature of this role, we are unable to provide visa sponsorship. Resumes and communication must be submitted in English.  Responsibilities Test and validate first-class software serving thousands of businesses every day. Review requirements, specifications and technical design documents to provide timely and meaningful feedback.
