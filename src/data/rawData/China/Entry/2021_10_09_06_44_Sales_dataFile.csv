Sales Operations China,TrendMD,China,1 week ago,Be among the first 25 applicants,"About us We've created the world's premier recommendation system for peer-reviewed scholarly content. When a site joins our network, we gather information on reader behavior on that site. Then we use that data to recommend other articles that person might like. If you've ever seen the recommended links by a scientific paper online, that's us.  Our goal is reducing the time it takes for new discoveries to permeate the research world. With well over 2 million scholarly articles published each year, finding relevant research can take far too long on its own — and in that gap lies preventable suffering from curable medical conditions. We're not a startup. We've been profitable for over a decade, and we're still growing. Our overarching goal is to apply new technologies to problems that affect billions of humans. Everything we do points toward our north star, and our organizational culture is no different. We value clear communication, constant curiosity, and advancement based on respect and merit, not politics.  Expect talented, motivated co-workers from over 36 countries on 6 continents, all united by a performance-driven, egalitarian Silicon Valley mindset. You'll enjoy the freedom to schedule your own hours, with a high value placed on uninterrupted work time -- we ruthlessly cancel any meeting that could have been resolved by text message.  About the role We're looking for a China-based Sales Operations role with a few all-important character traits: Candor: You value honesty and problem-solving over the appearance of politeness. You're not afraid of confrontation, but understand the value of each interaction. People respect you because you use candor as a tool to build them up, not a weapon to break them down. Conscientiousness: You genuinely like other people. In particular, you understand that the people who work with you are more than disposable assets. You aspire to be an unblocker, working to help others succeed and trusting them to return the favor. First-principles thinking: You're allergic to dogma, habitually question institutional knowledge, and never fall back on ""common sense"" to explain anything. You make your decisions based on credible evidence. You don't start working on any project unless you can explain why you're doing it.  Tenacious, data-driven, and client focused, this role is much more about mindset than experience.  We are looking for a candidate that is bold, has creative willpower, and possesses the ability to seize the initiative. Gathering and analyzing metrics will be as important as being a face for the agency, and building new partnerships that help optimize revenue streams. Ultimately, you’ll become a central source of knowledge who can help anyone on the team make informed decisions.  The Sales Operations role will build processes to bring in new Chinese clients. By tracking our sales operation in as much detail as possible, you'll become a clearinghouse for information on what we do well and what can be done better. You will pass relevant information to clients to help them feel fully briefed and in control of their campaigns.  Our perfect candidate in a Sales Operations role is a gifted networker, a compulsive goal-setter, and a natural at taking unforeseen issues in stride. You use analysis to determine the correct direction and push through until you reach the destination. A proven track record of building relationships in advertising, publishing, or SaaS would set you apart from other candidates.  Responsibilities Prepare readership data spreadsheets and reports for clients Ensure that all items are invoiced and collected on time Familiarize yourself with our product and our admin dashboard Set up and maintain campaigns for clients Support finance and HR departments with their work Offload any other miscellaneous work required to keep sales and account management productive Be the backbone of the administrative operations  Ideal candidates have Comfort with ambiguity — you can set priorities without needing to be directed Excellent written and verbal communication skills in English Strong analytical and quantitative powers A focus on detail, with extremely strong organizational skills  You should include these in your application A PDF of your CV in English shared via URL LinkedIn profile URL A cover letter shared via URL will cause us to prioritize your application  Send materials to: careers@trendmd.com  Seniority: Entry-level Employment type: Contract Job function: Contributor",,Contract,,
