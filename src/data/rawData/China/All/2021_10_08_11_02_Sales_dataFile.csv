Sales Operations China,TrendMD,China,1 week ago,Be among the first 25 applicants,"About us We've created the world's premier recommendation system for peer-reviewed scholarly content. When a site joins our network, we gather information on reader behavior on that site. Then we use that data to recommend other articles that person might like. If you've ever seen the recommended links by a scientific paper online, that's us.  Our goal is reducing the time it takes for new discoveries to permeate the research world. With well over 2 million scholarly articles published each year, finding relevant research can take far too long on its own — and in that gap lies preventable suffering from curable medical conditions. We're not a startup. We've been profitable for over a decade, and we're still growing. Our overarching goal is to apply new technologies to problems that affect billions of humans. Everything we do points toward our north star, and our organizational culture is no different.
