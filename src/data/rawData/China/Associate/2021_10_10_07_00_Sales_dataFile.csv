If you take responsibility or if you act self-disempowering defines you as a “player” or a “victim”. Are you taking the role of a “victim”, always in the hands of external forces and not able to influence the outcome yourself? Or are you more of a “player”, where you are in control of what is happening and could affect the outcome?  Player-Learner  This works best when everyone in the company takes responsibility for their own response to any situation (player mindset) and is truly curious about the opinions and ideas of others (learner mindset).  Player-Learners inspire trust; they are energized and embrace change; they listen, find out, share, collaborate, take risks, find solutions, learn by doing, encourage and celebrate.

If you take responsibility or if you act self-disempowering defines you as a “player” or a “victim”. Are you taking the role of a “victim”, always in the hands of external forces and not able to influence the outcome yourself? Or are you more of a “player”, where you are in control of what is happening and could affect the outcome?  Player-Learner  This works best when everyone in the company takes responsibility for their own response to any situation (player mindset) and is truly curious about the opinions and ideas of others (learner mindset).  Player-Learners inspire trust; they are energized and embrace change; they listen, find out, share, collaborate, take risks, find solutions, learn by doing, encourage and celebrate.
